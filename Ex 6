Investigate the following project management areas of interest:
	1. Statement of scope
	2. Feasibility Study, (Technical, Financial, Social)

1.

The statement of scope is what needs to be achieved and the work that must be done to deliver a project.

	Definition:   
		" The work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result
		with the specified features and functions"

This involves project goals, deliverables, features, functions, tasks, deadlines, and ultimately costs. As
a project manager, you'll need to define porject scope

Once you've established these things, you'll then need to specify which of these will be used in the project i.e. what 
is relevant and what aspects are not to be included


- Desired results/ End product
- Needed resources
- High-level overview
- Acceptance criteria
- Team member responsibilities
- Required work to deliver
